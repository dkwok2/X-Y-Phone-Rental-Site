Note: Completed sections are mainly located in index.html and rateus.html. Other sections require improvement and further development but features include:
- A responsive star rating on rateus.html
- A typing animation on both index and rateus
- Working links to all pages except follow us on the footer
- A slide-up-down animation for the phone on index

- Add a form page(both contact and rating) (Medium Priority)
- Add a media query for responsiveness (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Find ways to store forms and ratings (Low Priority)
- Add a toggle day/night mode
- Add a thank you for participating page
